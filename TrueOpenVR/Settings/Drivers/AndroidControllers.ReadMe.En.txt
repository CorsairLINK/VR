Android Controllers


In the application, enter the IP address of your computer.

The application has bugs, so to enter an address or port it is necessary to insert it from the exchange buffer (copying from notes or from somewhere else).

The application allows you to switch from the left to the right controller and vice versa. You can use only 1 Android smartphone, for some applications this will be enough (Google Earth, VR Player, VR Photos and so on).

By default in the application test screen, to switch to the main screen, make a svayp, on the left side of the screen, from left to right and a list of screens appears (interface as in video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V1yee-_5PA).

You can also change the shoulder parameters and sensitivity in "AndroidControllers.ini".

If you want to use 2 smartphones instead of 2 controllers, then for the second smartphone, in the application, write port 5556.
